## Overview

Polls CoinGecko's `/simple/price` REST endpoint every 30 seconds and maintains a rolling 24-hour price history per coin. Every 500ms, it computes percentage changes over a configurable time window, normalizes them into speed values, accumulates car positions, and broadcasts the result as JSON to all connected WebSocket clients.

Originally built as the backend for [CryptoGP](https://github.com/yourusername/CryptoGP), a Formula 1-style crypto race visualizer.

## How It Works

1. **Polling** — A Tokio task hits `/simple/price` every 30s, fetching all configured coins in a single request.
2. **Storage** — Each price tick is appended to a `VecDeque` per coin and pruned to 24 hours.
3. **Percent change** — Finds the oldest tick within the selected time window; falls back to the oldest available tick during startup.
4. **Speed normalization** — Maps percent changes linearly to `[0.3, 1.5]` across all coins. Equal movers all get `0.9`.
5. **Position accumulation** — Every 500ms: `pos += speed × dt`, wraps at `1.0`.
6. **Broadcast** — Serialized `RaceState` JSON is pushed to all clients. Dead connections are pruned via `retain`.

## WebSocket Protocol

Connect to `ws://localhost:9001/ws`. The server pushes a message every 500ms.

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.123Z",
  "time_window": "5m",
  "cars": [
    {
      "symbol": "bitcoin",
      "display_name": "Bitcoin",
      "price": 63241.50,
      "percent_change": 2.34,
      "speed": 1.12,
      "position": 0.73,
      "color_hex": "#e63946"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 | Server time of computation |
| `time_window` | `"1m"` \| `"5m"` \| `"15m"` \| `"1h"` \| `"24h"` | Active price window |
| `percent_change` | `f64` | Relative to window open; `+` up, `-` down |
| `speed` | `f64` | Normalized to `[0.3, 1.5]` |
| `position` | `f64` | `0.0` = start, wraps at `1.0` (lapping) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable, 2021 edition)
- A [CoinGecko Demo API key](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) (free)

### Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set COINGECKO_API_KEY in .env
cargo run
```

Server starts on `http://localhost:9001`.

### Test the WebSocket

```js
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9001/ws');
ws.onmessage = e => console.log(JSON.parse(e.data));
```

Data arrives every 500ms. Prices populate after the first CoinGecko poll (~30s).

## Configuration

All settings via `.env`:

```env
PORT=9001
COIN_IDS=bitcoin,ethereum,solana,binancecoin,cardano,dogecoin,ripple,avalanche-2,polkadot,chainlink
DEFAULT_TIME_WINDOW=5m
BROADCAST_INTERVAL_MS=500
POLL_INTERVAL_MS=30000
COINGECKO_API_KEY=your-demo-key-here
```
